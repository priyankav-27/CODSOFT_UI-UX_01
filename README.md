   - Includes input fields for users to enter their personal information such as name, email, password, etc.
   - Implements validation to ensure that all required fields are filled out correctly.
   - Offers options for password strength indication and password visibility toggle.

3. **Verification Screen:**
   - Displays a verification code input field for users who opt for email or SMS verification.
   - Generates and sends a verification code to the user's provided email or phone number.
   - Allows users to request a new verification code if needed.

4. **Confirmation Screen:**
